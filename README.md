## Emoji Only 😃

**Constraints are the best creativity boost!** if you want to express yourself in twiter, you have to be able to do so in 255 characters, but in Chirp, we go a step further. You migth think that it would be too hard to comunicate only with emojis, but [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) sujests an image is worth a thousand words or even more!, therefore you get 2500 words without feeling like you're reading an article!

You have a problem with someone? An idea you want to share? Chirp is the place to go!
