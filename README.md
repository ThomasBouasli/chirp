# Chirp 🐦


A simple twitter clone, with the core mechanic being...

## Emoji Only 😃

**Constraints are the best creativity boost!** if you want to express yourself in twitter, you have to be able to do so in 255 characters. That makes you consise and direct. At Chirp, we take the same ideia and go a step further!


## But... is it useful ❓

yes.

You migth think that it would be too hard to comunicate only with emojis, but [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) sujests an image is worth a thousand words (or even more!). Therefore you get much more information in significantly less characters. This saves time both for the writer as for the reader! And talk about data efficiency, our servers will never get full!

You have a problem with someone? An idea you want to share? Chirp is the place to go!
